              2 factor authentication for login is used as a security mechanism.
              When user trying to login to the system he will receive OTP to his
              mobile phone. So If an attacker steals the email and password of a
              user he cannot login to the system unless he has ownerâ€™s mobile
              phone.
              <br />
              <br />
              Another security mechanism is AWS Web application firewalls. The
              firewall helps to protect our API from common web attacks and
              bots.
              <br />
              <br />
              Json web token are used to communicate between API and the UI.
              After user login to the system API will given a token to the
              frontend. So UI send request to the API along with the token. So
              the attackers cannot access our API without the token.
